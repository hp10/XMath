XMath is a program that helps you learn basic math equations to the point where they become instinctive to answer.
This is by far not the best way to learn these facts, but was a fun project to work on.
XMath can run on windows 10/11 (XMath most likely runs on earlier versions of windows as well but it has not been tested on them.)

To download XMath, place the file "Download.bat" in the directory that you wish XMath to be downloaded into.

Then, run the file (windows deffender will probably blook this because the file is from another computer, run anyways), all the files will automatically be downloaded into the same directory.

Terminal.bat is the file that allows you run: XMathDoubles.bat, XMathA.bat, XMathD, XMathM, and XMathS.  Terminal.bat also runs rungetq.bat, which hashes the files and checks for mistakes.

datetest.temp stores the most recent day the XMath Terminal was opened so the Terminal can tell you if your on a streak (which do not carry over from other months).
